## Prometheus Concept: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Prometheus Concept, available now on Android!

This is an open source Android app. The source code is available on GitHub.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect and store any personally identifiable information. The app will only transmit your supplied username to the server for the duration of a game, but will not keep it once the game has terminated.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please open an issue.
